## How to add a company
To add a company to the table, create a module in the `company_data` directory.

Here is an example some example module contents that you can copy
and modify:

```python
from company_data import RemotePolicy
from helpers import scrape

name = "GitLab"
business = "DevOps"


def remote_policy():
    """Extensive info about their remote culture"""
    url = 'https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/'
    return RemotePolicy.REMOTE_FIRST, url


def hiring_region():
    """Listings for global and regional remote jobs"""
    url = "https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/all-jobs/#Engineering"
    return "global", url


def engineering_glassdoor_rating():
    """Average glassdoor rating for engineers"""
    url = 'https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/GitLab-Engineering-Reviews-EI_IE1296544.0,6_DEPT1007.htm'
    return scrape.glassdoor_engineering_rating(url), url


def overall_glassdoor_rating():
    """Overall average glassdoor rating"""
    url = 'https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-GitLab-EI_IE1296544.11,17.htm'
    return scrape.glassdoor_rating(url), url


def tech_stack():
    """A selection of the tech listed on stackshare.io"""
    url = "https://stackshare.io/gitlab/gitlab"
    tech = 'js, ruby, go, postgres, redis, nginx, k8s'
    return tech, url


def salary():
    """Senior Software Engineer in USA"""
    url = 'https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salary/GitLab-Senior-Software-Engineer-US-Salaries-EJI_IE1296544.0,6_KO7,31_IL.32,34_IN1.htm'
    return scrape.glassdoor_salary_range(url), url
```

To update the above table, run:
```sh
python update_readme_table.py
```

## Note regarding the code
The Python code in this repo is not written to a professional standard.
The naming of functions and modules is unorthodox and there are no tests,
type hints or logging.

This is intentional. Python is used here as a scripting language,
so brevity, simplicity and expressiveness take centre stage.
