Below is information on tech companies that hire _fully_ remote roles.

There are two categories for _Remote Policy_: remote-first and remote-friendly.
These categories are a bit fuzzy but should hopefully give some indication
of how seriously a company takes remote work.

Here are the rough criteria used:

* remote-first
    * The majority of the workforce are fully remote
    * They hire internationally regardless of where their offices are
    * They identify as remote-first in their employer branding
* remote-friendly
    * Remote workers may be a minority at these companies
    * They only hire within the region in which their offices are based

There is a mixture of manually gathered data and things like average ratings
and salaries that are automatically scraped and periodically updated.
Hyperlinked data lead to their sources. Most hyperlinks also contain
tooltips you can view by hovering over them.

## How to add a company
To add a company to the table, create a module in the `company_data` directory.

The modules contain an attribute for all rows in the table. These attributes can be
bound to either:
- strings, which are simply copied to the table
- or functions which are used to create hyperlinks.
  These functions return a tuple of `(link_text, href)`
  and their docstrings are used as tooltips.

Once you've added or modified a module in `company_data`, run this script:
```sh
python update_readme_table.py
```

*Note:* The values in the table are cached in the `.cache/` directory of
your local repo to avoid making too many HTTP requests every time the table is updated.
To clear the cache and get fresh values run a command like the following:
```sh
rm .cache/company_data.gitlab.*
```

Here is an example some example module contents that you can copy
and modify:

```python
from company_data import RemotePolicy
from helpers import scrape

name = "GitLab"
business = "DevOps"


def remote_policy():
    """Extensive info about their remote culture"""
